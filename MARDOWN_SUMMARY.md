Using two asterisks **this text is bold**.  

Two underscores __work as well__.  

Let's make it *italic now*.  

You guessed it, _one underscore is also enough_.  

Can we combine **_both of that_?** Absolutely.

What if I want to ~~strikethrough~~?

## PARAGRAPHS

There cannot be # Titles in the ## middle of a paragraph.

This paragraph should display as is

  This indented paragraph should not be indented in output

  Because all lines are stripped           

This line is normal.
This newline without blank line before should print on the same line as the last one, after a space.

If there is many spaces       in a middle or end of a   paragraph, only    one is printed


Many blanklines before or after should print only one.
